# Pillager Trading Mod

This mod lets you... well, trade with pillagers.

## Description

To trade with Pillagers you must first find an Illager Manuscript in a Woodland Mansion chest. After selecting a trade,
it will tranform into an Illager Order. Holding an Order in your hand will make pillagers passive towards you. 
Interact with a pillager with the required price and the Order in your hands, and he will give you the items.

Their prices are not cheap at all, but they sell some rare things.

## Features

- The available trades are data-driven and can be modified as recipes (of type pillagertrading:pillager_trading)
- Right-clicking the manuscript will open a GUI in which you can select your trade
- Orders display a tooltip with the trade
- Pillagers will not trade if the player is in a raid, has Bad Omen or Hero of the Village

## TODO

- Add custom sounds for declining and accepting trade
- Add custom pose instead of default one
- Villagers scared of players holding an illager order
- Illager Statue (right-click to toggle patrols, right-click to toggle wandering trader)
- Emerald Core (villagers are attracted to it)
- Lapis lazuli Core (used to activate Illager statues for 10 minecraft days)
- Guilded Stone Bricks / Guilded Deepslate Bricks
- Review trades
- Add Config
